```RPG```
```Souls-like```
``` Stealth``` <br />
## Class
You can choose your initial class. Each class has no difference other than initial attributes. You can level up any of your attributes later on.  <br />
You can either play stealthily without alerting any enemies like an assassin or fight recklessly like a god of war.  <br />
## GamePlay
The basic gameplay is to clear the patrols you see on the path and defeat the boss at the end of the map. <br />
Be patient. Tumple to dodge the enemy's attack first and then find the right timing to attack.
## Death 
Try not to die. Once you die you will respawn from your spawn point and lose half of your current exp as the penalty. <br />
